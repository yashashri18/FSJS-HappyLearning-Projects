    <h1>Shortset Js Program/ Window and this keyword</h1>

    <h2>Shortest js program = empty file</h2>

    <h4>even we run empty js program , gloabl execution context is created</h4>
    <h4>Js also creares the memory space</h4>
    <h4>Js engine creates window object(in a global space) with lots of functions and methods</h4>
    <h4>window is a global object which is created along with GEC</h4>
    <h4>In case of browser only , the window is gloabl object</h4>
    <h4>similar to window js engine also creates this and at the global level this points to the window object</h4>


    <h3>The Global Window Object</h3>
    <h4>In case of browser , the global object is window</h4>
    <h4>The global object can be different can for diff environemt(eg for servers it can be diff, for node it can be diff)</h4>
    <h4>At global level - this === window</h4>

    <h4>Global space - anything which is not inside the function comes under global space</h4>

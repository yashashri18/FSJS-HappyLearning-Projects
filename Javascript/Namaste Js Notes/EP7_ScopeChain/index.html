        //Scope - where you can access a specific variable or function in our code
        //eg - 
        //what is the scope of variable b === where can I access a
        //other way of saying - is b inside scope of some function a 

        //The scope of variable directly depends on Lexical environment

        function a(){
            var b = 10;
            c();
            function c(){
                console.log(b);
            }
        }
        a();
        //console.log(b)

        //c's lexical parent is a , a's lexical parent is Global



        //Whenever a execution context is created
        //lexical environment is also created

        //lexical evnt = local memory + lexical envt of its lexical parent

        //lexical = in hierarchy, in a sequence
        //in the above code we can say that 'c' function is lexically sitting inside 'a' function
        //where some code is present inside other code

        //in the above pragram
        //execution context of c has a ref to execution context of a
        //execution context of a has a ref to global execution context
        //i.e lexical parent of 'c' is 'a' because 'c' is lexically inside 'a'
        //hence 'c' will get access to lexical environment of 'a' also

        //when line 23 - is going to execute 
        //js checks if b is present in its local memory
        //as it dont find
        //now js goes to ref and goes to lexical envt of parent i.e a in this case
        //so it gets the value of b , and it print in console

        //if b is not present in a also. in that case it checks in a's parent i.e global ec's lexical envt
        //the lexical parent of GEC is null
        //this way of finding is called as scope chain

        
        //Scope Chain - is the chain of lexical envt  and parent references

        //if js does not find anything in local memory , it goes one next level of scope chain  and continues


        //What is Scope ? - where you can access a specific variable or function in our code
        //What is Scope Chain ? - (is the chain of lexical envt  and parent references),The scope chain refers to the hierarchical structure that determines 
        //the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions within a particular execution context 
        //It is formed by the nested scopes and their respective parent-child relationships.
        //What is lexical evnt?  = local memory + lexical envt of its lexical parent

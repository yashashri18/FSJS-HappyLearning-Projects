        //getName(); //output - Namaste Js
        //console.log(x); //output - undefined
        //in most of the programming language this syntax will give error 
        //because we are calling the getName(),x before its initialization
        //in many programming languages - we can not access variables, functions before its initialization
        
        // but in JS this is not an error

        //Because of Hositing 
        //Hositing is a phenomenon in JS where we can access varibales and functions before we have initialize it

        //This all happens due to the memory creation phase of Execution Context
        //before the js code starts executing , the memory is allocated to each and every variable and function
        //for variables - a special value 'undefined' is stored 
        //and for functions the complete block of code is stored(actual copy of function)
 
        getName(); //Namaste Js
        console.log(x); //undefined
        //console.log(y);//throws error - ref x is not defined
        //here undefined and not defined are not the same things
        //for y it is giving not defined ,. because it is not defined anywhere in the programs
        //hence in the phase of memory allocation , memory is not allocated to y
        
        console.log(getName); //it prints the complete function
        console.log(getName2); // undefined - arrow fn is like a variable
        console.log(getName3); //undefined - behaves like a variable

        //1. normal variables
        var x= 7;
        //2. function
        function getName(){
            console.log("Namaste Js");
        }
        //3. arrow function - when arrow fn is stored in variables , the getName2 behaves like a variable
        var getName2 = () =>{
            console.log("Namaste Js");
        }
        //4. another way to declare function - here also getName3 behaves like a variable

        var getName3 = function(){
            console.log("Namaste Js");
        }

        //getName();//this behaves as expected - because we are calling function after it is defined
        //console.log(x);//this behaves as expected - because we are printing varibales after its declaration
